Hi gyus ,
This is my application for Android Automotive for HVAC demo project for getting FAN speed from the Car.
The projet is made up using the MVVM with clean architecture and using the Jetpack Compose .
This is the only prototype project and does not directly calling in car API , you can use this project just to understand how we can call the VHAL layer using latest architecture pattern.
More updates will come soon.
